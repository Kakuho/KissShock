# Kiss Shock:

A game engine heavily inspired by the doom 93 engine, with aspirations to make 2.5d precure games.

# Technology:

The engine is retro, in the sense that the 3d rendering will be done entirely on the cpu (i.e, software rendering). 

There is a framebuffer which presents pixels that can be written and read to by the renderer, we then make the
framebuffer a texture that fills the entire screen
